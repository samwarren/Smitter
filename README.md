git restructuring to include java files


Testing to do: test that upon creating username u and password p it is saved in firebase, you can login as u with p, that u can post a tweet as u and have it connected
test multiple active users

Stretch goals: make it so that a user has a username rather than just their email, query for a specific tweet hashtag
